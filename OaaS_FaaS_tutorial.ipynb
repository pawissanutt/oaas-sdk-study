This eliminates the need for a separate, external database for managing application state.\n",

        "  * **Methods**: `update_status()`, `get_status()`, `reserve()`, `turn_light()`.  \n",
        "* **`ParkingLot` Class**: A stateful object that manages the entire lot.  \n",
        "  * **State**: A list of `ParkingSpot` object instances.  \n",
